# Basic Form demo

The `product` app demonstrates how to use form and data model separately and `other_product` app demonstrates how to use the data model for the form. This is useful, when we have strong relation between the data and the form so we can skip all the duplicate configurations for the data model and form, because they will be nearly the same.
